# ThermodynamicsForEngineers
A Thermodynamics textbook designed for a single-semester Thermodynamics course.

In order to make changes, the Latex files are all in the src folder.

Once made, recreate the book using "tectonic -X build".

The new file will be at "build/Thermodynamics/Thermodynamics.pdf".
